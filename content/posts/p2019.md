Yesterday I ran across a blog post that claimed her daughter’s AP classes were worth $60,000. In her mind, that made her daughter’s “excruciatingly challenging time in high school” \[her words\] worth it.

What’s the truth? Is taking AP classes like saving money for college? (possible keyword saving money for college)

But were her AP classes really worth $60,000? I’m sure she did the math one way and came up with that answer. (graduated in 3 years) But let’s do the math more than one way and come up with the real, or most likely, answer.
