Last week I showed you the[ first step in the new book cover design for the Miri Attwater series. ](http://192.168.1.34:4945/behind-the-books/new-website-new-cover-miri-attwater-oceans-secret/)

Of course Miri canâ€™t stay black and white. ðŸ™‚ Next step, color!

Oops! Something is wrong with this pictureâ€¦ do you know what it is? I didnâ€™t even catch it. One of my girls pointed it out.

Hint â€“ one of the colors is wrong.
