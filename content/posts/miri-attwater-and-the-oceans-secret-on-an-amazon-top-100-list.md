The mermaids in Miri Attwater and the Ocean’s Secret are based on the mermaids of Greek and Roman mythology. Miri’s last name is Poseidon and several of the other names used in the book are from mermaids of myth. As far as the actual myths go, though, I turned all of them on their heads.

Do mermaids truly sing to lure sailors to their death? Not in Miri Attwater and the Ocean’s Secret!
