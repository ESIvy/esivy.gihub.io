(Confetti and streamers compliments of my TechBoy! Arenâ€™t they great? I would have added some cheering and clapping but itâ€™s just annoying when you click on a website and your speakers start blaring. So, youâ€™re welcome.)

<span style="color: #3366ff;">*As if finding out sheâ€™s a mermaid isnâ€™t shocking enough, now Miri has to spend her summer at the bottom of the ocean!* </span>

<span style="color: #3366ff;">*Slimy pets, weird and salty food,â€¦* </span>

<span style="color: #3366ff;">*Miri doesnâ€™t think sheâ€™ll ever get used to any of it.* </span>

<span style="color: #3366ff;">*But the mermaid city of Kai Kaona is so beautiful, sheâ€™s made some special friends, and sheâ€™s surprisingly good at hulikela, a type of underwater dancing. Then, just as she decides things arenâ€™t too bad after all, the coronation crown is stolen. Is she going to be stuck at the bottom of the ocean forever?*</span>

Find out how Miri copes with living at the bottom of the ocean and see what adventures she gets into. Check it out on [Amazon.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HKK1GYC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00HKK1GYC&linkCode=as2&tag=esiv-20 "Buy it on Amazon!")
