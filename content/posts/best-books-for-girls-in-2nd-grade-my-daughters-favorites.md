In second grade, readers can really take off. Or not. Don’t be worried if your child hasn’t turned into a reader yet. Just focus on making fun books available. If you don’t read kids’ books for your own entertainment (I do!) you might have trouble coming up with some suggestions for your daughter. But better than my suggestions, are the suggestions of another girl. Here are 9 of the best books for girls, my daughters’ favorite books in second grade, ordered roughly in order from the easiest to read to the more difficult.
