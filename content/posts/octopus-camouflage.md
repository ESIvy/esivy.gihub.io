![best books for girls : All That Glitters cover 188 x 250](/uploads/2014/01/All-That-Glitters-cover-188-x-250.jpg)In celebration of the release of Book 2, [Miri Attwater and All that Glitters](http://www.amazon.com/Attwater-Glitters-Mermaid-Princess-Adventures-ebook/dp/B00HKK1GYC/ "All that glitters amazon"), I thought it would be fitting to go a little into the science behind the magic of the Miri Attwater series.

When I first started the Miri books, my intention was to write pure fantasy, with magic and everything. Magic makes things easy. Yeah, I know you have to come up with rules but ‚Äì need something? Make up a rule and bam, you have something. It‚Äôs magic!

The problem was, every time I got to the point in the story where Miri‚Äôs legs magically turned into tails, it just didn‚Äôt feel right to me. Even though other writers used it ‚Äì in fact the original myths even used it ‚Äì it still felt hollow and unbelievable. I mean, how could legs turn into tails?

Really.

I knew it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúreal,‚Äù but still my brain wanted to understand *exactly* how that could happen.

And then I saw a video of octopus camouflage.

And I believed.

Watch. And believe. üôÇ
