I’m so excited that [What We Do All Day](http://www.whatdowedoallday.com/) has featured [Miri Attwater and the Ocean’s Secret!](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087451I2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0087451I2&linkCode=as2&tag=esiv-20)

[![Miri Attwater and the ocean's secret](../uploads/2012/09/oceans-secret-cover-190-x-250.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087451I2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0087451I2&linkCode=as2&tag=esiv-20)

It’s listed in their post, [Mermaid Books and Crafts for Kids](http://www.whatdowedoallday.com/2014/06/mermaid-books-crafts-kids.html "mermaid books").

Erica’s son read the book and said, “It was good, even though it was a book for girls.” 🙂 I love that quote!

I’ll readily admit that Miri definitely has “girl appeal.” So I think that means the story has to be twice as good for a boy to enjoy it. I find that comment high praise, indeed.

[What We Do All Day](http://www.whatdowedoallday.com/) is a great blog written by a mom of two active and intelligent boys, about the books they read and fun activities to fill your summer days. In the [post about mermaid books,](http://www.whatdowedoallday.com/2014/06/mermaid-books-crafts-kids.html) there are lots of great crafts and other great books. So if you’re looking for some “cool” fun for this summer when you can’t actually get wet or just looking for a great read, head on over and [check it out!](http://www.whatdowedoallday.com/2014/06/mermaid-books-crafts-kids.html)
