This is the second in a short series of posts where I’ll show you how to set up a Facebook author page. In the [first post](http://192.168.1.34:4945/web-tutorials/how-to-create-facebook-author-page "how to create a facebook author page"), I went over Facebook profile vs. Facebook page and how to sign up for a profile first.

Now we’re going to sign up for a Facebook page.

I found some really good general instructions on ustandout.com, so why reinvent the wheel? Watch their video and read their steps after you read the specifics for an author page below.

When you get to the step where you pick a brand category, pick “Artist, band, or public figure.” </span>

(Well, WordPress just won’t make the pretty. Arg. I want you to have the images anyway. Moving on.

4\. Continue following the steps until you get to “Add a cover photo.” I’m going to show you how to make a cover photo for your author Facebook page step-by-step, complete with a Pixlr template, in the next post.
