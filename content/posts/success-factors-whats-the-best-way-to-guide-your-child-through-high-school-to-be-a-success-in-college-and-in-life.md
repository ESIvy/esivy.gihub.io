![wikipediacommonSteacieLibraryRaysonho 467x350.](/uploads/2014/04/wikipediacommonSteacieLibraryRaysonho-467x350..jpg)What is the best way to guide your child through high school to be a success in college and in life? What are the success factors you need to instill in your kid?

I don’t know.

If that’s not the best way to get you to quit reading right now, I don’t know what is. But I’ll follow that by saying that these posts are about my *looking for* the best way to guide my kids through high school. And as with anything I do, I always research it. Thoroughly.

I first started thinking about this when our oldest was in 2nd grade. We were trying to make the decision about whether or not to have him tested for GT. My husband and I had both been in GT programs, and we had mixed feelings about them. We weren’t concerned so much with whether or not our son earned a label, but whether or not it would be beneficial. So I started talking to some parents with older GT children.

One call in particular stood out to me. As I made my way down a list it was getting fairly late; it was approaching 9:00 pm. The mom I called had time to talk because she was waiting for her son to get home from Boy Scouts; he was close to completing his Eagle Scout requirements. She had everything laid out and ready for him. There was “a history project that we have to make a model for, and then we have an English test to study for and math homework to do…”

We went on to talk about the GT program (she was a fan) and I gained a lot of insight from her. But even more than the GT discussion, what stood out to me was that little glimmer of what high school might be like for a bright kid at a moderately competitive high school. It sounded like there was a good three hours of homework – at least – laid out that wouldn’t be finished until midnight and beyond, and it sounded like a normal occurence.

And there was that comment “we.” Now, I think this was an exceptionally bright kid, and the parents were just doing what they felt they had to do to keep his head above water. And I know this kid got into a great university. So I can’t fault the parents on their approach. But still, I wondered. Is a full load of AP classes (Advanced placement classes) and extracurricular the *best* approach for success in college, more importantly, success in life?

If a kid can’t complete all their homework on their own, shouldn’t that mean that there’s *too* much homework? Or am I just being lazy – because I was finally done with school and wasn’t ready to start back up again?

What do you think? What’s the definition of too much homework? How much should parents help their kids with their homework?
