You might notice some changes in the website’s navigation. I’m preparing to do a complete redesign. To try and get a better idea of what I want, I’ve done a hack of my current theme. You might have noticed that the menu has changed. Take a look at the new [homepage](http://192.168.1.34:4945) and try finding your way around. (On my computer it looks better on Chrome than Firefox, but it still works. Something to look for in my new theme.) Did you find any new sections of the website that you’d missed before? What would you like to see more of? Let me know what you think!
