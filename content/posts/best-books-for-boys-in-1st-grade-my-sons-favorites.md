In first grade, kids are just getting started with independent reading. [I strongly believe that reading *enjoyment* is important, especially for early readers.](http://192.168.1.34:4945/draft2766) If you don’t read kids’ books for your own entertainment (I do!) you might have trouble coming up with some suggestions for your kids. But better than my suggestions, are the suggestions of another kid. Here are 4 of the best books for boys, my son’s favorite books in first grade.
