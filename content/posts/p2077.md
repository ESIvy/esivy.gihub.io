Outliers: The Story of Success, by Malcolm Gladwell: “Once someone has reached an IQ of somewhere around 120, having additional IQ points doesn’t seem to translate inot any measure able real world advantage.”

Also from Outliers: the famous Lewis Terman intelligence study that started in the 1920s. Terman was trying to identify gifted kids and predict the next world leaders, such future Nobel Prize winners. He failed to select a single one. Not only that, but his study discarded two future Nobel Prize winners as not being smart enough to be geniuses. (In constrast, to my argument of GT giving students advantages, Terman gave his choices many advantages, giving them advice and writing them recommendations. In spite of this, his “geniuses” failed to achieve the greatness he thought they would.)

“<span style="color: #3a3a3a;">Poland decided that, you know, the research showed the later you do that, the better everyone does; so the longer you wait, the better the system performs. So they moved until age fifteen, the time at which they would stream kids into a more academic sort of advanced placement university track versus vocational track. And that, among other changes, seemed to be the most impactful one, where they saw their kids going from below the average developed world to at or above average.”</span>
