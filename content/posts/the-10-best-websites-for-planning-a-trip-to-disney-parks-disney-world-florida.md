1. [![Undercover Tourist](http://www.ftjcfx.com/ji98y7B-53PXWQTWSSPVVSXRST)](http://www.kqzyfj.com/ge108kjspjr6ED7AD996CC9E89A) [Undercover Tourist ](http://www.kqzyfj.com/ge108kjspjr6ED7AD996CC9E89A)– We bought our tickets here in 2013 and it was one of the best things I did to plan for the trip. Ticket prices went up after we bought our tickets, and when we entered the trip we were able to convert them to the new tickets at no cost – for a cost savings! We purchased the [Disney World Base Tickets.](http://www.dpbolvw.net/de81cy63y5LTSMPSOOLOPPNTSS) We didn’t get the park hopper option, and never even wished we’d had it. I think you’d only use this if your either a Disney veteran who goes several times a year, or someone who wants to see a tiny portion of every park in fewer than 4 days.
2. [tripadvisor.com](http://www.tripadvisor.com/) – Comparing the cost of Disney Property to off-site, we chose to go with off-site. You can find [all of the hotels around Disney World here.](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g1954828-Disney_World_Florida-Hotels.html) But after reading a bunch of forums I narrowed my search down to finding one of the [hotels near Disney Parks in Kissimmee, Florida.](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g34352-Kissimmee_Florida-Hotels.html) [Best Western Premier Saratoga Resort Villas](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34352-d3217188-Reviews-or10-BEST_WESTERN_PREMIER_Saratoga_Resort_Villas-Kissimmee_Florida.html#REVIEWS%5D) is where we ended up staying.

I printed them out and took them with us. They also have a [month at a glance analysis of crowd level, weather, and events etc. ](http://www.easywdw.com/disneybest/disney-world-calendar-of-crowds-cost-weather-events/ "Disney tips calendar")This calendar is fantastic! Once you zero in on a month click over to the [more detailed month views](http://www.easywdw.com/category/calendar/08-august-2014-crowd-calendar/) for even more analysis of which parks to go to each and every specific day, based on crowd analysis, events, and more! Since we’ve gone, the folks at EasyWDW have put out a book, and I bet it’s as great as their website, [The easy Guide to Your First Walt Disney World Visit (be sure to check for current year.)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1941500064/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1941500064&linkCode=as2&tag=esiv-20&linkId=XHPHM7I2UXLLU6YK "Buy it on Amazon. Check current year.")
4. [EasyWDW forums](http://www.easywdw.com/forums/) – The best place to go for any question about Orlando Theme Parks you can dream up. The folks here are super helpful and informed.
5. [![Disney Parks](/uploads/2014/07/Unofficial-Guide-to-Walt-Disney-World-2014-181x300.jpg)touringplans.com](http://touringplans.com/) – This is a subscription site but you get a discount if you buy their book; it’s the website for the Unofficial Guide books. If you’re a total newbie to Disney World, reading their book [The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1628090006/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1628090006&linkCode=as2&tag=esiv-20&linkId=AWGTQBN5OPKMYTDQ "Buy it on Amazon!

This is where I started learning how to plan after our trip to Disney World in August where we stood in long lines.

7. [Keeping Cool on Attractions in the Summer Heat](http://www.mouseplanet.com/9685/Keeping_Cool_on_Attractions_in_the_Summer_Heat) – Gives strategies for keeping cool as well as locating the attractions that will give you the most time in air-conditioning. A must if you’re going to be in Florida during the summer months!
8. [Disney Parks Moms Panel](http://disneyparksmomspanel.disney.go.com/home.aspx) This was a question and answer forum. You can ask a question or just hang out and read all the answers.
