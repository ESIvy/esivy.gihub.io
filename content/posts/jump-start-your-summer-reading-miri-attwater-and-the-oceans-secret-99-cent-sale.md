Summer reading should be fun! *Miri Attwater and the Ocean’s Secret* is a mermaid princess adventure for ages 6-12. Here’s what a few reviewers had to say.

<span style="color: #ff00ff;">If you like funny fantasy books you’ll love this. It is fantastic. If you do not think it is great, you are crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </span>– Hannah, Age 9, [Book-cubs.com](http://www.book-cubs.com/2013/06/24/miri-attwater-and-the-oceans-secret-by-e-s-ivy/)

<span style="color: #ff00ff;">“\[Miri Attwater and the Ocean’s Secret is\] a really neat mermaid story like no other for girls ages 6 – 12. I read the first book in the series and got really caught up in the story. I wanted to read more!” </span>– [Amanda’s Books and More](http://abooksandmore.blogspot.com/2013/05/5-mermaid-ebooks-giveaway.html)

<span style="color: #ff00ff;">“a </span><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">wonderful book for young readers who love mermaids and princesses. It’s in a modern setting, so it’s easy for them to put themselves in Miri’s shoes (fins?).”</span> – [reads4tweens.com Best Books of 2012](http://reads4tweens.com/category/best-2012/)</span>

And, shhhh! Don’t tell your kids, but they might just learn something while they’re busy having fun!

*<span style="color: blue;"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">What I absolutely love about this book is how the author uses scientific facts to create a rule system for this “magical” world. You learn about how a mermaid changes from legs to fins in a way that makes it believable and magical all in the same breath.</span> </span>*– [Booksbabiesandbows.com](http://www.booksbabiesandbows.com/2013/05/miri-attwater-and-oceans-secret-by-es.html)
