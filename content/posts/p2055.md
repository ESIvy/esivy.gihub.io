It just occurred to me that in my quest to figure out what to do for my kids, I appear to be getting caught up in how we fix the whole educational system. Iâ€™m not going to be able to manage doing that before even my youngest graduates from high school. ðŸ™‚ But, this really is about educating myself before guiding my kids. So eventually I will circle around to trying to figure out if the current system is at best not working, and at worst setting kids back, and what can be done within the current system.
