In second grade, readers can really take off. Or not. Don’t be worried if your child hasn’t turned into a reader yet. Just focus on making fun books available. If you don’t read kids’ books for your own entertainment (I do!) you might have trouble coming up with some suggestions for your son. But better than my suggestions, are the suggestions of another boy. Here are 8 of the best books for boys, my son’s favorite books in second grade.
