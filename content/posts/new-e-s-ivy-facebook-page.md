Well, I went and did it. I really did it this time.

I‚Äôm now on facebook. (eek!)

A facebook page, to be exact.

I have never, ever been on facebook. (I know, hard to believe.) I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing. So if you get a chance, drop by and let me know if I‚Äôm doing it all wrong. üôÇ

In other news, I‚Äôve also got an updated author photo and a new avatar. So you‚Äôll see a ‚Äúnew face‚Äù associate with me around the web. Dizzy took the photos for me.

I‚Äôll be updating this webpage with photos, book covers, here there and everywhere‚Ä¶ eventually. But for now you can find my new facebook page here: <https://www.facebook.com/E.S.IvyAuthor>

Come by and say hello! And if you‚Äôd like to keep up with my book news through facebook, please like my page.
