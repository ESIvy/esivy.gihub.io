New laws in the EU require that a website disclose any time they keep data on visitors. This is mainly to address sites like Facebook collecting lots of data, but to the best of my knowledge here is what it means for this site. I only collect the minimum of data required to try to keep comments spam free (with no profanity) and deter hacking of my websites (this site has 18,357 blocked log in attempts to date). Some other sites I Iink to may collect data, such as affiliate links (to date, affiliate income is less than my cost of running this site) and Google analytics collects data (which I use to do things like index my pages to Google so readers can find me more easily.) At some point I may have a newsletter sign up again. Some further explanation is below.

Who we are
----------

Our website address is: http://192.168.1.34:4945. This is the website for a children’s book author, E.S. Ivy.

What personal data we collect and why we collect it
---------------------------------------------------

### Comments

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data to help spam detection: data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

### Media

If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

### Cookies

If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. For example, videos on Youtube.com are covered under [Google’s privacy policy.](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

### Analytics

How long we retain your data
----------------------------

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

What rights you have over your data
-----------------------------------

If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

Where we send your data
-----------------------

Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.

### Google Analytics

**Data Used:** Please refer to the appropriate [Google Analytics documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsTrackingOverview#howAnalyticsGetsData) for the specific type of data it collects.

**Activity Tracked:** This feature sends page view events (and potentially [video play events](https://jetpackme.wordpress.com/support/for-your-privacy-policy/#video-hosting)) over to Google Analytics for consumption.

### Jetpack Comments

**Data Used:** Commenter’s name, email address, and site URL (if provided via the comment form), timestamp, and IP address. Additionally, a jetpack.wordpress.com IFrame receives the following data: WordPress.com blog ID attached to the site, ID of the post on which the comment is being submitted, commenter’s local user ID (if available), commenter’s local username (if available), commenter’s site URL (if available), MD5 hash of the commenter’s email address (if available), and the comment content.

**Activity Tracked:** The comment author’s name, email address, and site URL (if provided during the comment submission) are stored in cookies. [Learn more about these cookies](https://jetpack.com/support/cookies/#comments).

**Data Synced ([?](https://jetpack.com/support/what-data-does-jetpack-sync/)):** All data and metadata (see above) associated with comments. This includes the status of the comment.

### Protect

**Data Used:** In order to check login activity and potentially block fraudulent attempts, the following information is used: attempting user’s IP address, attempting user’s email address/username (i.e. according to the value they were attempting to use during the login process), and all IP-related HTTP headers attached to the attempting user.

**Activity Tracked:** Failed login attempts (these include IP address and user agent). We also set a cookie (`jpp_math_pass`) for 1 day to remember if/when a user has successfully completed a math captcha to prove that they’re a real human. [Learn more about this cookie.](https://jetpack.com/support/cookies/#protect)

**Data Synced ([?](https://jetpack.com/support/what-data-does-jetpack-sync/)):** Failed login attempts, which contain the user’s IP address, attempted username or email address, and user agent information.

### Subscriptions

**Data Used:** To initiate and process subscriptions, the following information is used: subscriber’s email address and the ID of the post or comment (depending on the specific subscription being processed). In the event of a new subscription being initiated, we also collect some basic server data, including all of the subscribing user’s HTTP request headers, the IP address from which the subscribing user is viewing the page, and the URI which was given in order to access the page (`REQUEST_URI` and `DOCUMENT_URI`). This server data used for the exclusive purpose of monitoring and preventing abuse and spam.

**Activity Tracked:** [Functionality cookies](https://jetpack.com/support/cookies/#subscriptions) are set for a duration of **347 days** to remember a visitor’s blog and post subscription choices if, in fact, they have an active subscription.

### WordPress.com Stats

**Data Used:** IP address, WordPress.com user ID (if logged in), WordPress.com username (if logged in), user agent, visiting URL, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, country code. *Important:* The site owner does **not** have access to any of this information via this feature. For example, a site owner can see that a specific post has 285 views, but he/she cannot see which specific users/accounts viewed that post. Stats logs — containing visitor IP addresses and WordPress.com usernames (if available) — are retained by [Automattic](https://automattic.com/) for 28 days and are used for the sole purpose of powering this feature.

**Activity Tracked:** Post and page views, [video plays](https://jetpackme.wordpress.com/support/for-your-privacy-policy/#video-hosting) (if videos are hosted by WordPress.com), outbound link clicks, referring URLs and search engine terms, and country. When this module is enabled, Jetpack also tracks performance on each page load that includes the Javascript file used for tracking stats. This is exclusively for aggregate performance tracking across Jetpack sites in order to make sure that our plugin and code is not causing performance issues. This includes the tracking of page load times and resource loading duration (image files, Javascript files, CSS files, etc.). The site owner has the ability to force this feature [to honor DNT settings of visitors](https://jetpack.com/support/wordpress-com-stats/#honoring-dnt). By default, DNT is currently not honored.
