It can be tricky to pick a domain name for a lifestyle blog. I like the terms “lifestyle blog” or “mommy blog” because the topics can be so broad on them, which is what has turned out to happen here in my little corner of the internet. But in some ways, that seems to make coming up with a domain name and buying a URL more difficult.

But before I get into all that, maybe your wondering – Exactly what *is* a domain name? And if you look on the internet (like I did), it will become clear to you that all of the definitions were written by software engineers who knew *exactly* what they were talking about. But after you read their three paragraph definition *you’ll* have no clue what they’re talking about.

Here’s a simple way to define domain name.

Look at that string of letters in your browser bar. That’s this webpage’s URL. (On this webpage right now you should see http://192.168.1.34:4945/picking-a-domain-name-for-a-lifestyle-blog. It will change after I switch over to my new domain name.)

A simple way to define URL is the address of a webpage on the internet.

The *domain name* is part of the webpage’s URL; it’s the “title” or “name” that comes immediately after either “http://” or “www.”, before the next dot back-slash (/).

As I write this post, the domain name for this website is **esivy.com.** You can see it in the URL for this webpage in your browser bar at the top of this page which I’ve copied below:

http://**esivy.com**/picking-a-domain-name-for-a-lifestyle-blog

If you go to the homepage of a web***site***, like [www.amazon.com](http://<a%20target=%22_blank%22%20href=%22http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=ur2&tag=esiv-20&linkId=XAFBZVRW6ULJQODX%22>Amazon%20homepage</a><img%20src=%22http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=esiv-20&l=ur2&o=1%22%20width=%221%22%20height=%221%22%20border=%220%22%20alt=%22%22%20style=%22border:none%20!important;%20margin:0px%20!important;%22%20/>), you’ll see only the domain name in the browser bar.

If you go to another page on the website, like this one for [Miri Attwater and the Oceans’ Secret](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/098623530X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=098623530X&linkCode=as2&tag=esiv-20&linkId=PTTNMEUFRAIGFVGG), after the domain name you’ll see bunch of other letters or numbers to give the address for that specific web***page*** on the web***site*** Amazon.com.

So, now back to choosing a domain name for a lifestyle blog. Why come up with a clever domain name for the URL of a blog? It seems like the title bar on this webpage has had “creative tagline in the works for here” for ages. I’ve done lots of thinking and brainstorming trying to come up with a blog name.

I’ve read on the internet:

[How to choose a domain name by Amy Lynn Andrews](http://amylynnandrews.com/how-to-choose-a-domain-name/)

[4 Things to Consider When Choosing Your Domain Name by ProBlogger](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2015/05/13/4-things-to-consider-when-choosing-your-domain-name/)

And I’ve read books:

[Everything But the Posts](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615919294/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0615919294&linkCode=as2&tag=esiv-20&linkId=TSNOU6XJIFKMCIXI)

[How to Blog for Profit: Without Selling Your Soul](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0692236511/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0692236511&linkCode=as2&tag=esiv-20&linkId=C3V5MI35PIOGNZHK) (disclaimer, I am a *long* way from that profit part)

I looked for inspiration from parenting, mommy and lifestyle blog s with names I like. (Surprisingly, if you search for “top mommy blogs” or “best lifestyle blogs” you’ll come up with nothing that’s useful. Nada. Zilch. So I’ll include a list of the best lifestyle blogs with names I like at the end of this post.)

But the perfect domain name was elusive. A few months ago, I gave up. I took comfort in the fact that lots of blogs were starting to just use the names of their author. But, I did notice that while I’ve learned some bloggers’ names, I’m more likely to remember a clever blog URL the first time I encounter it.

I’m going to be making the switch soon to the Genesis platform, and while I was researching it I came across the new lifestyle blog, [MyCrazyEverAfter.com](http://www.mycrazyeverafter.com/). So clever. So easy to remember.

So I was once again inspired to brainstorm. And then, while I did my after-school pickup run I came upon a brilliant solution! I enlisted the help of my daughters.

I was *really* tempted to go with the first suggestion of my youngest, CoolerMomThanYours. (Actually, she insisted I should spell it CoolerMomThanYurs.)

I mean, what mom wouldn’t love that? But we kept at it and we finally came up with one we all liked!

New face of the blog coming soon at MomBehindTheCurtain.com.

\*And here’s that list I promised of my top mommy blogs or lifestyle blogs with the best names to give you some inspiration for your own blog name.
