Book cover design is fun! Challenging, but fun. In past posts weâ€™ve showed you [the original pencil sketch of Miri](http://192.168.1.34:4945/behind-the-books/new-website-new-cover-miri-attwater-oceans-secret/ "New Cover for Miri Attwater and the Oceanâ€™s Secret Coming Soon") and [the first colored version of her face](http://192.168.1.34:4945/?p=1065).

Or course, for the new cover of [Miri Attwater and the Oceanâ€™s Secret](http://www.amazon.com/Attwater-Oceans-Mermaid-Princess-Adventures-ebook/dp/B0087451I2), we needed Miri to be more than just a floating head. Ask TechnoTim, getting the hands right was the hardest part. Iâ€™m really good at telling him when something doesnâ€™t look quite right. ðŸ™‚ Keep in mind that while TechnoTim is drawing this, heâ€™s also teaching himself how to use a new computer art program!

The first cover was made in [PhotoShop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopfamily.html), which heâ€™s used for years. To make this kind of illustration, he needed to work in vector art. This time heâ€™s making the cover in [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/). (Which is free.)

Besides drawing more of Miri, the hair changed a bit too. Itâ€™s shorter and the curls are a bit softer. But, thereâ€™s still the same mistake from last week. Have you spotted it yet?
