If you‚Äôre using this as a Pixlr tutorial, we‚Äôll be using [Pixlr](http://pixlr.com/ "pixlr") for free photo editing. In this post you will learn how to open an image from a web URL in Pixlr, how to undo in Pixlr, and I‚Äôll introduce layers in Pixlr and image size in Pixlr (in other words, on images, what does 200 x 200 mean? What are pixels?).

I will assume that you know nothing about using Pixlr for on-line free photo editing. I only started using it a few months ago, so I really know what it‚Äôs like to know nothing. üôÇ Fortunately, I have a little Photoshop in my distant past and a resident Photoshop whiz, TechnoTim, for consulting.

In this series of posts, I‚Äôm going to show you step-by-step how to create a stunning cover photo using [Pixlr](pixlr.com "Pixlr") for free online photo editing. I‚Äôll even provide a free Pixlr Facebook page cover photo template for Pixlr to make it easier!

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">To make your facebook cover photo, you‚Äôll need to know </span>[why a book author needs a Facebook page instead of a profile.](http://192.168.1.34:4945/web-tutorials/how-to-create-facebook-author-page)<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> You also need to </span>[sign up for your Facebook page](http://192.168.1.34:4945/web-tutorials/create-facebook-author-page-step-2-signing-facebook-page "signing up for a facebook page")<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">. Did you do that? Go back and look at those posts. I‚Äôll wait.</span>

Okay, now that you‚Äôre up to speed, you‚Äôre going to want to make a Facebook cover photo to pretty up your page. For inspiration I looked at the facebook pages of two indie author super-stars, [Lindsay Buroker‚Äôs facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/LindsayBuroker "Lindsay Buroker's facebook page") and[ J.F. Penn‚Äôs (of the CreativePenn.com) facebook page.](https://www.facebook.com/TheCreativePenn)

Based on their designs, I made a cover photo for [my own Facebook pag](https://www.facebook.com/E.S.IvyAuthor "E.S. Ivy Facebook page")e using Pixlr.

You can hop over and see the real thing on my facebook page, [https://www.facebook.com/E.S.IvyAuthor.](https://www.facebook.com/E.S.IvyAuthor)

The first thing you‚Äôll notice different from the image above and the one you see on the facebook page is that the cover photo above doesn‚Äôt have the profile photo. Facebook overlays that for you. Lots of tutorials just tell you to avoid that general area. But the perfectionist in me just couldn‚Äôt handle that! Exactly where that photo overlaps can really affect the aesthetics of the page. So I‚Äôve created a template that you can use in Pixlr.com to make sure you get everything in exactly the right place.

The cover photo I created for my author Facebook page has a pretty specialized background based on the cover of [Miri Attwater and the Ocean‚Äôs Secret.](http://192.168.1.34:4945/other/miri-attwater-oceans-secret-now-available-new-cover-amazon/ "Miri Attwater and the Ocean‚Äôs Secret now available  with a new cover on Amazon!") To get the dimensions just right, Techno Tim had to add add some more art to original art files. You can do that if you have the skill, but for now I‚Äôm going to show you how to make a cover photo with an easier background.

![Pixlr tutorial: Facebook cover photo](/uploads/2014/01/Facebook-cover-template-tutorial-white-no-gray-300-x-111.jpg "Pixlr tutorial: Facebook cover photo")To create the Facebook cover photo, I‚Äôm going to use [Pixlr.com.](http://pixlr.com "pixlr") If your not familiar with Pixlr, it‚Äôs a website where you can do free picture editing. You can think of it as Photoshop lite. The great thing is that it‚Äôs FREE. Completely free. You do all your editing on their webpage, Pixlr.com, and then save your files to your personal computer. I even used Pixlr to grab the images for this Pixlr tutorial!

Okay, let‚Äôs get started. To make a Facebook page cover photo like mine, you‚Äôre going to want to have images of your book covers saved to your computer. JPEG format will work; 300 x 400 will be more than big enough.

Pixlr tutorial: to make a Facebook page cover photo using a Pixlr Facebook page cover photo template
====================================================================================================

1\. Go to [Pixler.com](http://pixlr.com/ "pixlr").

2\. Choose Pixlr Editor.

![Pixlr tutorial: pixlr editor](/uploads/2014/01/pixlr-editor.jpg "Pixlr tutorial: pixlr editor")

3\. Choose Open Image from URL. (This way you won‚Äôt have to download my template to your computer. Pixlr will just open it directly from my site. So you don‚Äôt have to worry about downloading something you don‚Äôt know about to your computer. You *are* careful about downloading things to your computer, right? Because really, you don‚Äôt know me from JoeVirus.)

![Pixlr tutorial: open from url](/uploads/2014/01/open-from-url.jpg "Pixlr tutorial: open from url")

4\. Now where you see this:

![Pixlr tutorial: image URL](/uploads/2014/01/image-URL.jpg "Pixlr tutorial: image URL")

copy and paste: www.esivy.com/files/covertemplate.pxd

The file extension ‚Äú.pxd‚Äù is a special file just for using in Pixlr. It won‚Äôt open in any other type of program. Which means it won‚Äôt open on your computer, only in the Pixlr browser. So you‚Äôre computer is completely safe!

5\. Now you should be seeing this! (Minus the red circles and numbers.)

![Pixlr tutorial: pixlr areas](/uploads/2014/01/pixlr-areas.jpg "Pixlr tutorial: pixlr areas")

<span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span> ‚Äì is the picture you‚Äôll be working on. We‚Äôre going to call it the image area or picture area.

<span style="color: #ff0000;">2</span> ‚Äì is where you‚Äôll choose which tools to use

<span style="color: #ff0000;">3</span> ‚Äì is the navigator box where you can zoom in and out, choose layers, and see your editing history.

But don‚Äôt worry about remembering all that or trying to figure it out, I‚Äôm going to tell you everything you need to know; every click to make.

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Important Tip!</span> To undo anything, just like in your word processor, use Ctrl+Z. It will undo the last thing you did and you can work your way back. Write that down and stick it some place you can find it when you panic. üôÇ

6\. Look at the image area (area <span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span>). You will notice at the bottom it says 851 x 315. This is the size of the Facebook page cover photo in pixels. (More on that later. I mean, there‚Äôs enough information here already.)

See that little gray box in the lower left? This is where your profile photo is going to overlay your cover photo. Note: The placement of the profile photo is different for the Facebook *page* cover photo and the Facebook *profile* cover photo. This template is adjusted for the Facebook *page.*

The gray box is just a place holder. Before we save your final file, we‚Äôre going to turn that layer off.

What do I mean by layers? Think of the layers as a stack of transparent sheets laying on top of each other. The way we‚Äôre going to make this image, we‚Äôre only going to put one item on each layer. Don‚Äôt worry if that doesn‚Äôt make sense. As we go along I‚Äôll explain it a little more. Just for now, don‚Äôt worry about color-coordinating that gray box with anything, because it won‚Äôt be there in your final file. It‚Äôs just a place holder to make sure you don‚Äôt put anything important there.

In the next post, we‚Äôll start making the pretty stuff for your facebook page cover photo! We‚Äôll start with [how to make an author logo using Pixlr](http://192.168.1.34:4945/draft1335) ‚Äì -basically your name and some sort of tagline.(link won‚Äôt work if the tutorial isn‚Äôt live yet)
