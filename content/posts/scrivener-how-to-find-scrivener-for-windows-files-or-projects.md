[![find scrivener files on your computer](../uploads/2014/10/scriv-find-files-238x602.jpg)](http://192.168.1.34:4945/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/scriv-find-files-238x602.jpg)If you’ve been depending on using File &gt; Recent Projects to open your Scrivener files, you might have a moment of panic when you get enough projects started that one of them drops off the list! Where is it on your computer?

If you search the [Scrivener 1.7 for Microsoft Windows Users Manual, ](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/documentation/scrivener-manual-win-a4.pdf "Scrivener for Microsoft Windows Users Manual")you’ll find this clue:  
<span style="color: #ff00ff;">*“Projects can also be opened directly using the Explorer, or any shortcuts to the .scrivx file.”*</span>

But if you search in your file explorer (that probably looks like a stack of folders on your desktop or in your toolbar), for .scrivx you’ll find a whole list of “project.scrivx” and none of them will have your project names on them!

Which one is which? Which one do you open?

So, here’s the trick. You need to search for files with the .scriv extension. To do this, you can search for \*.scriv files – that will find everything with that extension. All of these special folders will have the name you used to name each Scrivener project and the .scriv extension.

Now, if you need help getting your projects to actually open, see [Scrivener – How to open an existing Project in Scrivener for Windows, fully explained.](http://192.168.1.34:4945/?p=2416)

If you’re new to Scrivener or find it faster to look things up in a book than to google every question, I’ve found [Scrivener for Dummies](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118312473/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1118312473&linkCode=as2&tag=esiv-20&linkId=ALNU4OC3TVIW3DUO) to be excellent!
