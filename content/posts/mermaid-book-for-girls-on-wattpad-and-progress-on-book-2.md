It’s been a while since I made a new post, I know!

And have you signed up for my [Newsletter](http://192.168.1.34:4945/newsletter/ "Newsletter")? Because I’ve definitely made good on my promise not to fill up your inbox. 🙂 I’ve sent exactly, um, zero newsletters so far.

It’s not that I don’t love my [Newsletter](http://192.168.1.34:4945/newsletter/ "Newsletter") subscribers! In fact there will be special offers soon, I promise. It’s just that it’s another thing with a learning curve. I spent a lot of time figuring out how to set up a sign up list. But how, exactly, do I send out a newsletter in the correct form? That’s something I’ve got to figure out, and for now I’ve been trying to focus all my time on…

Completing Book 2!

(Okay, that and I may have snuck in a trip to Disney World. But hey, I was thinking of you and Miri! There are lots of mermaids at Disney. There’ll be some related posts later.)

Which means I already have some things that need some changes. 🙁 But hang tight, Book 2 will be better for it, and ready soon!

Meanwhile, I’ve started posting [Miri Attwater and the Ocean’s Secret over on Wattpad](http://www.wattpad.com/story/5814158-miri-attwater-and-the-ocean%27s-secret). I post a chapter or so a week. So, if you haven’t read the Ocean’s Secret yet and you can be patient for the next installment, hop on over to [Wattpad](http://www.wattpad.com/story/5814158-miri-attwater-and-the-ocean%27s-secret) and say hello.

Happy Reading!
