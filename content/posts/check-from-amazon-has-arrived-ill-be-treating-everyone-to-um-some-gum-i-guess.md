</div>The earnings from Miri Attwater and the Ocean’s Secret has finally gotten big enough for Amazon to cut a first check! Woohoo! And it’s a whopper, a whole $103.09.

But in publishing you have to celebrate the little successes. And I must say, even getting a small check made me happy today.

What about you, what made you happy today? Happy Monday!
