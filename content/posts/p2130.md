According to Outliers, by Malcolm Gladwell, the success of Bill Joy (Sun Microsystems and Java) and Bill Gates (Microsoft) both occurred because they took the time to be obsessed with something. They did this by skipping other classes when they wanted to. This let them get to the 10,000 hours faster than others. One advantage of homeschooling is that you have a chance to go more in-depth with subjects that a kid is really interested in. Does this give you more opportunity to start building up 10,000 hours at a young age? Do more home schoolers because experts or entrepreneurs at a young age?
