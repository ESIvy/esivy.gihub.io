[![Miri Attwater and the Ocean's Secret](../uploads/2012/10/underwater_1250x200014-e1350659402706.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/Miri-Attwater-Oceans-Secret-ebook/dp/B0087451I2/ "Buy Miri Attwater and the Ocean's Secret")V.K. Finnish over at [www.vkfinnish.com](http://www.vkfinnish.com) gave [Miri Attwater and the Ocean’s Secret ](http://www.amazon.com/Miri-Attwater-Oceans-Secret-ebook/dp/B0087451I2/)a lovely review and would read it again!

V.K. said “I read *Miri Attwater and the Ocean’s Secret* with my 3rd grade daughter, and it was a big hit!…The story was … dotted with witty puns to go with the water theme. …\[the character\] Miri … had such a great spread of silliness about her, original humor, and fun, child-like way of looking at the events around her.”

You can read the full review over at [V.K. Finnish’s blog](http://www.vkfinnish.com/archives/1469) or on V.K.’s [Goodreads page](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/451716622).

Thank you V.K. I’m so glad you liked it! And I’m almost finished with Book 2, so that fans can follow Miri’s adventures in the underwater mermaid colony of Kai Kaona!
