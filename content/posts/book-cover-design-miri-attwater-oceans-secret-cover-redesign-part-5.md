Last week we looked at the [illustration of Miri for the new book cover design](http://192.168.1.34:4945/?p=1144) for the Miri Attwater series. But wouldn’t be much of a book cover without a background, now would it? We decided on a simplified version of [the original cover](http://192.168.1.34:4945/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/underwater_1250x200013-e1349278127252.jpg).

 What do you think so far? Next week – the new cover!
