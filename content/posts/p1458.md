This is it. The “official” launch day of Miri Attwater and All That Glitters!

(insert confetti cover)

*<span style="color: #ff00ff;">As if finding out she’s a mermaid isn’t shocking enough, now Miri has to spend her summer at the bottom of the ocean! </span>*

*<span style="color: #ff00ff;">Slimy pets, weird and salty food,… </span>*

*<span style="color: #ff00ff;">Miri doesn’t think she’ll ever get used to any of it. </span>*

*<span style="color: #ff00ff;">But the mermaid city of Kai Kaona is so beautiful, she’s made some special friends, and she’s surprisingly good at hulikela, a type of underwater dancing. Then, just as she decides things aren’t too bad after all, the coronation crown is stolen. Is she going to be stuck at the bottom of the ocean forever?</span>*

<span style="color: #000000;">The ebook is available for Kindle on Amazon now. \[make link\] My sales are low enough that even a *single* sale can make a huge difference in the ranking, so if you can hop over and buy a copy that would be awesome! It’s the age old conundrum of authors, that readers can’t buy the book unless it’s visible, and it’s not visible unless it sells in big numbers. A chicken or the egg problem. Of all the platforms, Amazon seems to be the one that increases visibility with modest sales (rather than taking payment only from big publishers for good placement.) So your vote counts! Go on over and make a difference. 🙂 &lt;end shameless plug&gt;</span>

In celebration of “launch week” I’m going to post the rest of this week with a representative sampling of what you can look forward to on this blog. (Links won’t work until the posts go live.) \[insert links\] On Wednesday I’ll have a post about the magical camouflage of octopuses. On Thursday I’ll post the directions for how you and your kids can make your own Winter Wonderland out of Styrofoam shapes, one of the original crafts that I developed and was published in Family Fun Magazine. And on Friday I’ll post a tutorial on how to embed a youtube video on your blog with a custom start time, end time, and without the recommended videos at the end.

I’ve also been hard at work on a tutorial to show you how to make a Facebook page cover photo (have you seen [my facebook page?](https://www.facebook.com/E.S.IvyAuthor "E.S. Ivy facebook page")) using the free on-line photo editor [Pixlr.com](pixlr.com "Pixlr").

So come back for more! Or better yet, sign up to follow this blog by email in the right side-bar and don’t miss a post. (It’s a different sign up from the [newsletter](http://192.168.1.34:4945/newsletter/ "Newsletter"), which is infrequent.)

And don’t forget to pick up your copy of Miri Attwater and All that Glitters in the Kindle store! *<span style="color: #ff00ff;">(Okay, so it wasn’t the end of the shameless plugs.)</span>*
