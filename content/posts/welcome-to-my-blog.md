Hi, Iâ€™m E.S. Ivy, writer of fun, middle grade fiction. I do a lot of research for my books, so if youâ€™re not careful you might accidentally learn something. ðŸ™‚

This blog will cover a variety of topics related to my books and turning kids into avid readers by making reading fun. I have a background in science and Iâ€™m also pretty crafty (Iâ€™ve published crafts in Family Fun Magazine) so all of that will influence the blog. For my first series, Miri Attwater, I also did a lot of research into the structure of governments and how they have evolved over time, so youâ€™ll find a little bit of history as well. Posts should occur about once a week, starting â€¦. umâ€¦.. soon, I hope!

Miri Attwater and the Oceanâ€™s Secret is currently available in Amazon! After I get all my blogs and webpages up and running, get the final draft of Book 2 off to proof readers, and learn how to sing on my [E.S. Ivy twitter account](https://twitter.com/ESIvy), Iâ€™ll start getting The Oceanâ€™s Secret up on other platforms including Barnes and Noble, Smashwords, and Kobo. If you have a vote for which platform you want it on first, let me know in the comments.

For now Iâ€™ll just leave you with a larger version of The Oceanâ€™s Secret to gaze at. I designed the cover and Techno Tim, my resident tech guy, made it a reality. I even got a refresher course in Photoshop and drew in some of the coral! Doesnâ€™t the yellow one in the lower right hand corner look particularly nice?
