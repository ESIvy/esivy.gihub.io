![Youtube video in WordPress and customize](/uploads/2014/01/Wordpress-youtube-tutorial-238-x-262.jpg)This post I‚Äôll cover Youtube videos in WordPress and Blogger. I‚Äôll go over: how to embed a Youtube video, how to customize the Youtube video end times and start times, and how to delete the recommended videos, all without using a plugin. Plugins are great, but they can slow down your site. So if I can do without them, I do.

I couldn‚Äôt find this anywhere on the web and I‚Äôm tickled to death that I figured it out myself! I‚Äôm not a computer coder. So if I can do it, you can too. The beautiful part is that we‚Äôll only be working in the text editor of your post. You won‚Äôt be touching any code that can mess up your entire site.

\*\*A quick note before we get started. I‚Äôm wrapping up launch week for Miri Attwater and All that Glitters with posts on two different blogs today.

I‚Äôm honored to have an [author guest post over at the blog of Kirby Larson,](http://kirbyslane.blogspot.com/2014/01/friend-friday.html "Kirby's Lane") fabulous Newbery Honor author of Hattie Big Sky. It‚Äôs my very first guest post, and what a place to start out! Talk about intimidating. Hop over and check it out!

You can [read an excerpt of Miri Attwater and All That Glitters](http://lisaisabookworm.blogspot.com/2014/01/read-excerpt-from-childrens-book-miri.html) at the fabulous book blog, Bookworm Lisa. She focuses on family friendly books, so go on over and maybe you‚Äôll find more than one book to read! \*\*\*\*

Okay, let‚Äôs get started with the WordPress tutorial for how to embed Youtube videos and customize them.

I found [how to customize a Youtube video for WordPress.com](http://en.support.wordpress.com/videos/youtube/ "Youtube videos on WordPress"), but it doesn‚Äôt work for my [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/ "wordpress.org") site. But I was able to modify it and make it work! Once you know the steps, it‚Äôs really simple. Bookmark this post in your browser so you won‚Äôt loose it. üòâ

How to embed a Youtube video in WordPress and customize it without a plugin
===========================================================================

1\. Start a new post in WordPress. When you first play around, you might just want to open up a post that has nothing in it. It makes finding your place in the text editor easier if there is nothing there!

2\. Find a video you want to use on [Youtube.com.](http://www.youtube.com/ "youtube videos") You can use the same video I‚Äôm using for this tutorial [Kuroshio Sea ‚Äì 2nd largest aquarium tank in the world ‚Äì (Please Don‚Äôt Go by Barcelona)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7deClndzQw "Youtube Biggest Aquarium"). I found this video while doing research for my book, [Miri Attwater and the Ocean‚Äôs Secret.](http://192.168.1.34:4945/miri-attwater-and-the-oceans-secret/ "Miri Attwater and the Ocean‚Äôs Secret") The images are awe inspiring. The people in front of the tank really give you a sense of the majesty of the ocean life. And the music is seriously gorgeous on this video. In fact, after watching this video I ended up buying [Barcelona‚Äôs](https://myspace.com/barcelona "Barcelona") CD so I could enjoy more of their music. (Yes, I still buy CDs. Don‚Äôt judge me.)

How to embed a Youtube video on WordPress so that you can customize it
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you follow the [WordPress directions to embed the video by just putting the web address without a hyperlink,](http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds "wordpress embed video") you won‚Äôt be able to customize it. So we‚Äôre going to embed it a different way.

3\. In WordPress, change from the Visual editor to the Text editor.

![embed youtube video in wordpress](/uploads/2014/01/text-editor.jpg "embed youtube video in wordpress text editor")

4\. Now go to the Youtube site of your video. Under the video you‚Äôre going to click: share <span style="color: #ff0000;">(1)</span>, embed <span style="color: #ff0000;">(2)</span>, and then you‚Äôre going to select and copy all of the code in <span style="color: #ff0000;">(3)</span>. Make sure you copy all of it Ctrl+A then Ctrl+C is a good way to do this on a PC.

![embed youtube video in wordpress share embed copy](/uploads/2014/01/share-embed-copy.jpg "youtube video in wordpress share embed copy")

5\. Go back to your WordPress post draft. Paste the text into the Text editing window.

[![youtube video in wordpress paste](/uploads/2014/01/paste1.jpg "youtube video in wordpress paste")](http://192.168.1.34:4945/wp-conte/uploads/2014/01/paste1.jpg)

6\. Click Save Draft.

7\. Now click Preview and you will get ‚Ä¶.NOTHING! Now listen (or read), because this is very important: In your preview window, click ‚Äì wait for it ‚Äì click reload on your browser page. And wallah! The video will appear.

Thanks very, very much to the video [Embed YouTube Videos In WordPress Blog Posts Without Plugins](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAdIN2Y2tyo "embed youtube video in wordpress reload trick") by <http://www.theextremewebdesigns.com/> for that little reload trick. I was about to pull my hair about before I found their tip!

Here‚Äôs what mine looks like when I do that. Go ahead and watch the video while you‚Äôre here. Like I said, it‚Äôs gorgeous. I‚Äôll wait.

Now, if you watched the video (Wait, you didn‚Äôt watch it? Really, watch it!) you‚Äôll notice that a selection of suggested videos came up at the end. I have a blog that‚Äôs aimed for children (for my children‚Äôs mermaid adventure series, [Miri Attwater](http://www.amazon.com/Attwater-Oceans-Mermaid-Princess-Adventures-ebook/dp/B0087451I2/ "Miri on Amazon")). I don‚Äôt want the blog to even accidentally send them to any questionable material. So I wanted to delete the recommended videos on Youtube from the end.

Now that I knew the reload trick, how to delete recommended videos on Youtube is pretty straightforward.

How to delete recommended videos on Youtube
-------------------------------------------

8\. Go back to your video on Youtube. Under your embedding code, unclick ‚Äúshow suggested videos when the video finishes.‚Äù <span style="color: #ff0000;">(4)<span style="color: #000000;">. Copy the new code <span style="color: #ff0000;">(5).<span style="color: #000000;"> Move back to your WordPress post editor, paste the new code in place of the previous code.</span></span></span></span>

![how to delete recommended videos on youtube video in wordpress](/uploads/2014/01/deleted-suggested-videos.jpg "how to delete recommended videos on youtube video in wordpress")

Now when you preview your page (and hit reload), when you get to the video there won‚Äôt be any recommended videos on Youtube shown at the end.

Hmmm‚Ä¶ but a few days later this video now does have ads. Well, I guess that‚Äôs a post for another day. Onward! Let‚Äôs change the start and end time.

I found out how to change the end and start time by trial and error. Here‚Äôs how you do it. (Without the trials and errors!)

How to change a Youtube video‚Äôs start time
------------------------------------------

9\. Decide where you want to start your video. Convert the start time into seconds.

I want to get the guy sticking his arms in the air, so I‚Äôm going to choose 26 seconds.

10\. Now go back into your Text editing window for your WordPress post. Find where it says: ?rel=0‚Ä≥

![embed youtube video in wordpress rel=0](/uploads/2014/01/rel0.jpg "embed youtube video in wordpress rel=0")

Between the zero and the quotes, insert: &amp;start=26

(Only replace 26 with what you want your start time to be, in seconds.)

![embed youtube video on wordpress change start](/uploads/2014/01/start.jpg "embed youtube video on wordpress change start")

Save draft. Preview and reload. You‚Äôll see that the start cursor will be down the video player timeline. Now let‚Äôs change the end time.

How to change Youtube end time
------------------------------

11\. Pick an end time for your video and convert it to seconds. I‚Äôm going to choose 1 minute 56 seconds which is 60 seconds + 56 seconds = 116 seconds.

12\. Between your start time and the quote add: &amp;end=116

Only replace 116 with your own end time.

![youtube end time customize youtube video in wordpress](/uploads/2014/01/end.jpg "youtube end time customize youtube video in wordpress")

Save draft. Preview and reload. On the video player timeline you‚Äôll see the segment that you‚Äôve designated, like in my video below. You can click on my video to see how it works. Before you Publish, make sure your own works.

These directions to customize a Youtube video worked on my WordPress.org site, as well as [my blogger site, miriattwater.com.](http://miriattwater.com "Miri Attwater")

My main occupation is being an author and writing these tutorials takes some of my writing time. I debate if it‚Äôs a good place to spend my time, but I‚Äôd like to give back a little to the on-line community that makes help so readily available. If you‚Äôve found this post helpful, please leave a comment and let me know. And, if you have a kid in your life, or a secret kid inside you, please check out my fantasy adventure books for kids and pick up an ebook for a couple of bucks:
