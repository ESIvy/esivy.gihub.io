[Why Can Some Kids Handle Pressure While Others Fall Apart?](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/magazine/why-can-some-kids-handle-pressure-while-others-fall-apart.html?pagewanted=all "Kids and Stress")

And a review of it:

[Six Big Problems With “Why Can Some Kids Handle Pressure …”](http://blog.chabris.com/2013/02/six-big-problems-with-why-can-some-kids.html "Review of why some kids handle pressure better")

Not to be confused with the fact that “handling pressure” is different from dealing with a schedule that’s a physical impossibility. At many high schools you can construct a schedule, that even if you were to understand everything perfectly the first time, a fast reader, writer, and calculator, it would be physically impossible to finish all the homework, especially if you have an extra-curricular activity.

Thought: If you enter college as a high school mega star, do you become a success later on, or do you just make the college look good for their stats on incoming freshmen?
