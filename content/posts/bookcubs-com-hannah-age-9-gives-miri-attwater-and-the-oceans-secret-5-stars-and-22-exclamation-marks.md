For kid’s books, there’s nothing better than a book review *by* kids.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[![Book Cubs Kids Book Reviews](../uploads/2013/07/5da18-bookcubs349x200.jpg "Book Cubs Kids Book Reviews")](http://www.book-cubs.com/2013/06/24/miri-attwater-and-the-oceans-secret-by-e-s-ivy/)</div>Here’s what Hannah, age 9, over at [BookCubs](http://www.book-cubs.com/2013/06/24/miri-attwater-and-the-oceans-secret-by-e-s-ivy/) had to say about Miri Attwater and the Ocean’s Secret.

<span style="background-color: white; font-family: 'Century Gothic', AppleGothic, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 22px;"><span style="color: magenta;">If you like funny fantasy books you’ll love this. It is fantastic. If you do not think it is great, you are crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span></span>

And as a writer, there’s nothing better than a kid’s review like that. 🙂 And yes, all those exclamation points are her’s – I didn’t add any.

Her favorite part was Miri’s dinner with the Queen. That makes me happy, because I had fun writing it. (Sneak Peek – there’ll be another fancy dinner with funny dishes in Book 2.)

Before I wrote about Miri’s first meal in Kai Kaona, I ate some seaweed salad! It wasn’t too bad. A little rubbery. 🙂 Some of the rest came from memories I have – like when someone advised me to order “seafood” noodles in Japan and it turned out to be “seaweed” noodles.

And the time at a fancy restaurant in New Orleans that my grandmother was served a baked fish with its head still on. She was a proper Southern lady, a phenomenal cook, and had cleaned a few fish from my grandfather’s catch in her day. She would never have served a fish head at her table. She sent that fish right back to the kitchen to be properly prepared!
