These attractions aren’t really hidden in the Magic Kingdom at Disney World, but they’re not the top hyped spots either. Sometimes that’s because they’re not the newest attractions, so the Professional Disney Park Trippers have been to them too many times. But our family could be considered novices, this was our tween/teens first trip to the Disney Parks at Disney World in Orlando, Florida. (They had only been to Disneyland once.) Here are the spots we’re glad we didn’t skip, and some of them we could have done more than once.

[It’s a Small World](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/its-a-small-world/) – This is still one of the best rides ever in my opinion. This ride just means “Disney.” And it’s a long, cool relaxing ride.

[Peter Pan’s Flight](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/peter-pan-flight/) – Flying over the night city near the start is my favorite part.

[Walt Disney’s Carousel of Progress](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/walt-disney-carousel-of-progress/) – I was afraid this would be a little cheesy for the teens. There’s really no mention of this in the guidebooks and there’s no basically no line. The last stage – supposed to be modern day – was a little dated. But the kids loved it! It’s kind of got that 50s science fiction nostalgia feel to it. There really did seem to be something special about the attractions that Walt himself dreamed up.

[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/big-thunder-mountain-railroad/) – Of all the roller coasters, you’ll hear the least about this one. But it’s our family’s favorite. It’s also a great step up before you get to bigger and faster coasters. Don’t miss all the fun scenes along the ride. You’ll notice something different every time.

[The Hall of Presidents](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/hall-of-presidents/) – I remember this from when I was younger, but I was surprised it still held a lot of appeal for my teens. It’s not crowded, and both the wait and the show are air-conditioned. Bonus!

[Under the Sea – Journey of the Little Mermaid](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/under-the-sea-journey-of-the-little-mermaid/) – In our opinion this is one of their best new animated rides. We did this ride during the fireworks display and were almost disappointed that there were no lines because there were lots of animated interactive displays and shady spots along the wait.

[Haunted Mansion](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/haunted-mansion/) – This ride has a shady line and inside it’s cool and dark. It’s more funny than scary, but our youngest still hasn’t forgiven us for taking her on it when she was 5. (For the record, I thought it wasn’t a good idea but Dad did!) So take care with little ones and help them find all the jokes.
