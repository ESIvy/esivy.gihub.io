There many lists claiming to be lists of the best kids books. Lists of hundreds — if not thousands— of kids’ books that are carefully curated for their “literary merit.” I’m not a literature expert, just a children’s book author – but most of all a mom – who loves reading, with a house full of readers.

I don’t know about you, but when I read those long lists I find myself asking, “Yeah, but are the books really any fun to read?” Because when it comes to reading for kids, that’s what I’m most concerned about, fun. [When a kid likes to read — *loves* to read — because it’s fun, the rest will follow.](http://192.168.1.34:4945/?p=2766)

And that’s why the books on these best kids book lists are what *my kids* consider the best books. The ones they’ve read over and over, remember fondly, and the ones who were a great distraction — a friend — in times of need. And that’s why there aren’t “neat numbers.” I didn’t add books just to get to 10 or 20 in a list.

Below are the lists I’ll be covering in this post series. Links will go live after the posts go live, and you’ll be able to use this as a reference list to navigate your way around.
