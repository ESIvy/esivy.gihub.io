When the Key family arrive at Balmoral to spend the weekend with the Queen on her summer break they will get a touch of the royal treatment – including personal valets and housemaids and a wake-up call from the Queen’s personal piper each morning.

Upon arrival early today (NZT), their cases will be whisked up to their rooms and unpacked by a personal valet and housemaids, who will also run baths for the family to refresh themselves.
