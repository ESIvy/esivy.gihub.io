I’m a bit late announcing this on the blog, but I was so thrilled when [Reads4Tweens](http://reads4tweens.com/) came out with a [best books of 2012](http://reads4tweens.com/category/best-2012/) list during the holidays. Miri Attwater and the Ocean’s Secret made the list!

Reads4Tweens says Miri Attwater and the Ocean’s Secret is … “a <span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Droid Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 22px;">wonderful book for young readers who love mermaids and princesses. It’s in a modern setting, so it’s easy for them to put themselves in Miri’s shoes (fins?).”</span>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[![](../uploads/2013/04/reads4tweenslogo.jpg)](http://reads4tweens.com/)</div>Reads4Tweens is a fantastic book review resource aimed specifically at parents and teachers trying to find books for kids to read. If you haven’t seen it yet, you really should check it out! The logo pretty much says it all, “because you want to know what they’re reading.” The reviews cover anything and everything you might be concerned about or want to discuss with your child.

Reads4Tweens was started by a mom trying to find good books for her kids. But she also happens to be very qualified to talk about children’s books. She has a degree in children’s literature, she’s taught literature in middle school and high school, and she’s currently a freelance editor. Needless to say, a great review from this caliber of reviewer was especially gratifying.
